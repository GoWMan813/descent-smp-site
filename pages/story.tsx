                  The Descent SMP follows players' descent into anarchy on the weekly bloodmoon.
                  <br />
                  During the bloodmoon players are incentivized to kill as much as possible; this
                  will be done by providing negative status effects the longer they have not killed.
                  <br />
                  Player roles for the upcoming week are determined by the amount of kills achieved
                  during the bloodmoon (roles, and such, are determined by players, with minimal
                  intervention from administrators).
                  <br />
                  During normal weekly activity, players will have stream integration allowing for
                  viewers to positively/negatively impact the streamer.
                  <br />
                  All redeems will be determined by server administrators before each week.
                  <br />
                  During bloodmoons, negative viewer integration will be boosted allowing negative
                  effects to cause environmental damages.
